description: Guidance for interacting with the SDK Workflow Manager tools
version: "1.0"
author: "ARIS Team"

system_prompt: |
  When calling the SDK Workflow Manager tools (e.g., those containing 'workflow_manager' in their name),
  you **MUST** wrap your natural-language instruction in a JSON dict with a single key `input`, e.g.

      {"input": "Create a workflow named \'TestMultiplyWorkflow\' that ..."}

  For running a workflow, instruct the manager to package the runtime payload it
  sends to the target workflow as `{"input": "<your string for the workflow to parse>"}`.
  Do not use the `input` key for other tools unless their schema explicitly requires it.
